# GCD-PnR
Implemented GCD euclid's algorithm using Cadence Innovus 

This project implements the physical design (Place and Route) of a GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) algorithm using Cadence Innovus. The GCD calculator is a digital circuit that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The PnR flow includes key steps such as floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and timing optimization to ensure efficient performance, area utilization, and power consumption.

This repository contains the complete physical design flow, including all scripts, configurations, and reports for the GCD calculator.
